FMA (Fundamental Martial Arts) is a practical, modern and no nonsense form of self defense training. The mission of FMA is to provide you the opportunity to train, to greatly improve your ability to protect yourself and those you love.

Over time, students develop genuine functional ability in managing and adapting to all types of attack. Students of FMA learn and practice solutions to issues like being grabbed, choked, against weapons, multiple opponents and much more.

FMA is not traditional martial arts and not sport; sport has weight classes, only one opponent at a time, no weapons and RULES.

The development of Fundamental Martial Arts points to Scott Shephard’s personal beliefs in what is important in studying Martial Arts and a result of the thousands of hours of training dedicated students. Many available martial arts today are a merger of several arts, or are “watered down” versions of an art. FMA has a lineage that is respected, but it is an evolution and is a fully refined meaningful martial art for today’s needs.

Fundamental Martial Arts was launched in 2006 by Scott Shephard, reflecting what he emphasizes in the studying of martial arts. Fundamental Martial Arts is designed to improve every student’s ability to protect themselves and to encourage general health and wellness. The primary quest is to build true skills in the student to prepare them as well as possible for a violent engagement. The training will always be geared to improving the ability of his students to manage a confrontation with a determined and aggressive attacker(s).

In a dangerous encounter, a measly kick in the groin or a pounding on his chest will not do. There are many feel good type studios out there that unfortunately provide an unrealistic confidence builder type atmosphere, where sub standard results are acceptable and the training methodology is obscenely optimistic. FMA believes that approach is irresponsible and not in the best interest of the student.

Fundamental Martial Arts is designed for the current world. Although we believe focus and attention to the material is critical, we dispense with bowing and wearing special outfits. We may wear a school t-shirt, but generally regular workout clothes and athletic shoes (instead of bare feet). We do have a ranking system for the student to understand their progress and to help organize productive training groups when appropriate, but we do not wear belts in classes. There is a great deal more to a street fight than breaking a board too. Having said that, Scott personally respects ancient masters and their followers who seek more of the other side of training provided by most traditional schools. This simply is not the heart of FMA, there is far too much to concentrate on in developing someone into a person who can manage the serious threats of the modern world.
